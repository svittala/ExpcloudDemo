    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_CallOut_CMP&gt;</code> component is a pure utility
        Lightning component. It provides a single method to execute a Web Service callout.</p>
    <p>It enables to trigger any kind of REST service request (either a GET,
        POST, PATCH...) to any URL (assuming it has been previously configured
        as a Named Credential or at least registered as a Remote Site) with 
        header or body parameters.</p>
<pre>&lt;c:PEG_CallOut_CMP aura:id="calloutUtil" /&gt;</pre>
    <p>The callout is performed asynchronously and the callback method (provided
        as input parameter) is called when receiving the result (or the error).</p>
<pre>component.find('calloutUtil').runCallOut(
     'https://ws4covea.herokuapp.com/personne',
     'POST',
     '{"Content-Type","application/json;charset=UTF-8"}'
     '{"lastname":"Smith","firstname":"John"},
     function(calloutResult,calloutError) {
          if (calloutResult) {
              // process OK (in calloutResult object)
              ...
          } else {
              // process KO (in calloutError object)
              ...
          }});</pre>
    <p>The URL may also reference a configured <code>Named Credential</code>
        by specifiying the targetURL as <code>callout:My_Named_Credential/some_path</code>.</p>
