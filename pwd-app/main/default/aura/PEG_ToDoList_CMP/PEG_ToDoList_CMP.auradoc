    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_ToDoList_CMP&gt;</code> component may be used in any type of
        Lightning page and is available directly in the App Builder (or Community Builder).
        It enables to display a time-line with a wide variety of objects retrieved via
        custom SOQL queries and ordered by a date field.</p>
    <p>Its look is similar to the standard activity timeline, but it offers the ability
        to display any object (e.g. lead, case, opportunity) instead of only Tasks and 
        Events.</p>
    <p>The set of information displayed for each object is configurable, as well as the
        ability to expand the associated compact layout of it (if the Lightning Data Service,
        a.k.a. LDS, supports it. See <code>lightning:recordform</code> component for details).</p>
    <p>It relies on the <code>&lt;c:PEG_SOQL_CMP&gt;</code> utility component to fetch data
        via SOQL and on the <code>&lt;c:PEG_Merge_CMP&gt;</code> one to customize the SOQL
        queries depending on the current Object or User.</p>
    <p>Most of its behaviour is configurable via simple App Builder configuration attributes
        (title, icon...). </p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>This component does not support lazy loading and the total number of elements
        returned by all the queries should remain relativey limited (e.g. 10s of records).</li>
    <li>The number of queries sent should also remain limited to reduce display latency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Data Fetch Configuration</h4>
    <p>The <code>queryListStr</code> configuration parameter enables to control the
        set of data fetched from the Salesforce database as well as its display</p>
    <p>It should contain a JSON array of JSON objects with the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>name</code>: Type of the Object displayed (SObject API Name)</li>
        <li><code>isCollapsible</code>: Boolean flag to display an expandable compact
        layout in the object tile (should be set to false for all object types not
        supported by the LDS).</li>
        <li><code>columns</code>: If the compact layout is displayed, number of
        columns on which the fields should be displayed.</li>
        <li><code>sortBy</code>: API name of the field to be used for global ordering
        of the displayed time-line (for the considered object type).</li>
        <li><code>color</code>: SLDS class to be used to color the time-line, usually
        the standard color fcorrresponding to the Object type (optional).</li>
        <li><code>icon</code>: SLDS Name of the icon to be used for each record of the
        object type (should usually be the one corresponding to the Object type, optional).</li>
        <li><code>query</code>: SOQL query to be used.</li>
        <li><code>display</code>: JSON object defining the field to be used as title
        for each record tile of this Object type, as well as the list of fields to 
        be displayed by default (i.e. out of the compact layout mentioned above).</li>
    </ul>
