    <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_NavigationManager_CMP&gt;</code> component enables
        to enforce the opening of the current record in a main tab of a
        Lightning console.</p>
        <p>It just needs to be put in the Lightning record page layout and 
        it automatically triggers a reopen App event (<code>c:PEG_TabOpen_EVT</code>
        with a special channel value) when the record is in subtab of a console
        App (none generated if in standard mode or in main tab).</p>
        <p>It relies on the <a href="/docs/component-library/bundle/c:PEG_ForceNavigation_CMP/documentation">
        <code>&lt;c:PEG_ForceNavigation_CMP&gt;</code></a> component to actually
        process the generated App event. This component
        should be added in the utility bar of the console.</p>
