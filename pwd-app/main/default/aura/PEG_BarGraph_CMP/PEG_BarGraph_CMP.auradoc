    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_BarGraph_CMP&gt;</code> component is a utility display Lightning
        component used to generate a Bar chart for a set of measure data split by one or two
        dimensions.</p>
    <p>It is primarily used by the <code>&lt;c:PEG_Graphs_CMP&gt;</code> App Builder Lightning
        component to display the <code>bar</code>, <code>horizontalBar</code> and <code>line</code>
        chart types.</p> 
    <p>It relies on the open-source <code>graph.js</code> library to display graphs
        as similar as possible as the ones found in the standard Lightning Reports
        and Dashboards.</p>
    <p>It displays a single measure split by a first dimension, possibly stacked by
        another one.</p>
