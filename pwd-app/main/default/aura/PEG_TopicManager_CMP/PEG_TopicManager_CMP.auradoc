    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_TopicManager_CMP&gt;</code> component enables to manage
        Topic assignments on Knowledge articles directly from the Lightning record
        page, whatever the community (aka "Network"). It complements the standard
        Topic component that ony enables to manage internal topics when on a CRM
        page.</p>
    <p><b>Warning</b>: This component only works with Knowledge article records,
        although it may be displayed for any record page (due to a technical constraint
        with the Knowledge__kav object in the component design file)</p>
    <p>It presents all the communities for which the article has topics assigned,
        each community being presented in a separate tile with a status icon and
        the description (if any set) below its name.</p>
    <p>For each community, it lists all the topics assigned to the article as
        pills within a container and enables (if not in read-only mode) to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add topics by selecting a network/community and a topic available, both
        from picklists and clicking on an "add" icon button.</li>
        <li>Remove topics by simply clicking on the "delete" icon button available on
            each Topic pill next to the topic label.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is limited amount of configuration available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Title</code> and <code>Icon</code> of the component card container
        (custom labels being usable for the title with the <code>$Label.c.LabelName</code>
        syntax)</li>
        <li><code>Show Border?</code> checkbox to add a wrapping border around the component card.</li>
        <li><code>Read-Only?</code> checkbox to use the component in read-only mode (no add/remove available).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This component relies on the following elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="/docs/component-library/bundle/c:PEG_SOQL_CMP/documentation">
        <code>PEG_SOQL_CMP</code></a> component to execute various SOQL queries 
            and DMLs (inserts/deletes).</li>
        <li>3 <code>PEG_Query</code> metadata values (the <code>PEG_Topic...</code> ones)
            to register the needed SOQL queries.</li>
        <li>3 <code>PEG_Topic...</code> custom labels for the "no topic" message or the 
            network / topic picklists selectors.</li>
    </ul>
