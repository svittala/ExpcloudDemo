    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_Action_CMP&gt;</code> component is a pure utility
       Lightning component. It provides a single method to execute an apex action.</p>
    <p>It enables to trigger any the executeAction apex action on any custom apex class
        implementing the <code>PEG_ActionHandler_SVC</code> interface.</p>
    <p>Additional parameters may be also provided as a single SObject.</p>
    <p>Result is returned via the onSuccess callback in case of success or the
        onError one in case of failure.</p>
    <p>The component should be instantiated in the parent Lightning component as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;c:PEG_Action_CMP aura:id="actionUtil" /&gt;</pre>
    <p>The action may then be triggered the following way:</p>
<pre>component.find('actionUtil').runAction(
     'myApexActionClassName',
     {"sObjectType":"mySObjectName","id":"myRecordId"},
     function(result) {
          // process OK (in result object)
          ...
     },
     function(error) {
          // process KO (in calloutError object)
          ...
    }});</pre>
