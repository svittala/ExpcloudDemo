    <h4>Component Overview</h4>
    <p>This component enables to present a custom display of a record consisting in
        a main header and various sub-tabs. Its primary use-case is for Knowledge
        articles, especially for structured display in a community (instead of
        the standard "Details" component).</p>
    <p>Record data may be fetched via LDS or custom SOQL (for Knowledge articles).</p>
    <p>A special feature enables to directly include external videos in the display
        from of a URL field.</p>
    <p>Work in Progress!!</p>
