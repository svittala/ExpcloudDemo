    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_KpiDisplay_CMP&gt;</code> component may be used in any type of Lightning
        page and is available directly in the App Builder (or Community Builder).
        It enables to display a card containing a configurable set of subcards displaying tiles of
        KPIs corrresponding to simple count queries.</p>
    <p>It relies on the <code>&lt;c:PEG_SOQL_CMP&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;c:PEG_Merge_CMP&gt;</code>
        custom utility Lighting components to execute all these queries in a contexual manner.</p>
    <p>Most of its behaviour is configurable via simple App Builder configuration attributes
        (title, icon...) and extensible in terms of actions available (both at KPI card and global
        levels).</p>
    <p>The main configuration is managed within the <code>kpiConfigStr</code> attribute, containing
        a stringified JSON structure of the KPI display card hierarchy.</p>
<pre>[
     {"icon":"standard:lead","label":"Leads","name":"Lead",
      "kpis":[{"icon":"utility:dayview","label":"Today","error":"5","warning":"2",
               "query":"select count(Id) from Lead where CreatedDate = THIS_WEEK WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED"},
              {"icon":"utility:reminder","label":"This Month","error":"5","warning":"2",
               "query":"select count(Id) from Lead where CreatedDate = THIS_MONTH WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED"}]},
     {"icon":"standard:opportunity","label":"Opportunities","name":"Opportunity",
      "kpis":[{"icon":"utility:dayview","label":"Today","error":"5","warning":"2",
               "query":"select count(Id) from Opportunity where CreatedDate = THIS_WEEK WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED"},
              {"icon":"utility:reminder","label":"This Month","error":"5","warning":"2",
               "query":"select count(Id) from Opportunity where CreatedDate = THIS_MONTH WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED"}]}
]</pre>
    <p>Note : Beware that direct <code>count()</code> queries are not supported for the time
        being, a <code>database.query()</code> apex statement being indeed executed.
        Please use <code>count(Id)</code> instead.</p>

    <h4>Advanced Color Configuration</h4>
    <p>It is possible to customise the color of the KPI icon leveraging the standard
        variants of the <code>lightning:icon</code> component for <code>utility</code>
        icons. Three colors are available : standard, warning and error.</p>
    <p>For each KPI definition, two thresholds may be defined, respectively for the 
        warning and error levels. A numeric value may be provided for each of these
        via the <code>warning</code> and <code>error</code> fields.</p>
    <p>By default, comparisons are made in increasing order, i.e. the icon will appear in
        orange (warning level) if the KPI value is superior to the warning level but lower
        than the error level. Comparisons may also be done in the other way by simply adding
        <code>"inverse":"true"</code> to the KPI definition.</p>
     <p>E.g. in the following example, the comparison is done in increasing order for the 
         first KPI and in decreasing order for the second.</p>
<pre>[
     {"icon":"standard:lead","label":"Leads","name":"Lead",
      "kpis":[{"icon":"utility:dayview","label":"Today","error":"5","warning":"2",
               "query":"select count(Id) from Lead where CreatedDate = THIS_WEEK"},
              {"icon":"utility:reminder","label":"This Month","error":"5","warning":"10", "inverse":"true",
               "query":"select count(Id) from Lead where CreatedDate = THIS_MONTH"}]}
]</pre>

    </div>      
            
    <div class="slds-m-top_large">
    <h4>Actions configuration</h4>
    <p>The configuration of actions is done via two attributes, which have a similar content
        based on the syntax defined for the <code>&lt;c:PEG_ActionGroupDisplay_CMP&gt;</code>
        component:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>tableActionStr</code> to define the main actions of the global containing card.</li>
    <li><code>kpiActionStr</code> to define the icon buttons on the each KPI sub-card.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Typically, these attributes must be configured with a JSON list of actions.</p>
<pre>[
 { "label" : "Calendar", "icon" : "open",
   "event" : { "name" : "e.force:navigateToObjectHome",
               "params" : { "scope" : "Event" } } },
 { "label" : "Tasks", "icon" : "open",
   "event" : { "name" : "e.force:navigateToObjectHome",
               "params" : { "scope" : "Task" } } }
]</pre>
    <p>For the KPI actions, the <code>icon</code> attribute is mandatory and should
        correspond to the name of one of the standard SLDS activity icons.</p>
    <br/>
    </div>
        
    <div class="slds-m-top_large">
    <h4>Advanced Actions Configuration</h4>
    <p>For KPI level actions, the applicable KPI JSON object is passed as input to the
        action trigger and may be merged within the event configuration via the 
        <code>Row</code> keyword. This enables to have a same set of KPI actions but with
        differentiated parameters.</p>
    <p>In the following example, a custom <code>target</code> field is added to the KPI
        JSON configuration.</p>
<pre>[
    {
        "icon": "standard:lead",
        "label": "Lead",
        "name": "Lead",       
        "target": "Lead",
        "kpis": [
            {
                "icon": "utility:dayview",
                "label": "Today",
                "error": "5",
                "warning": "2",
                "query": "select count(Id) from Lead where CreatedDate = THIS_WEEK WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED"
            }
        ]
    }
]</pre>
     <p>It is then reused as merge parameter to the triggered event in the KPI action
         definition.</p>
<pre>[
    {
        "icon": "new_window",
        "name": "Navigate",
        "event": {
            "name": "e.force:navigateToObjectHome",
            "params": {
                "scope": "{{{Row.target}}}"
            }
        }
    }
]</pre>
    <p>This is a simple illustration example, as the standard <code>name</code> JSON
        field could have been used. In such a case, the <code>{{{Row.name}}}</code>
        could have been used directly in the KPI action.</p>
