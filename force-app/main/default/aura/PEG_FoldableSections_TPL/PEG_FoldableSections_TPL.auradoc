    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_FoldableSections_TPL&gt;</code> component is a Lightning template
        usable to create any type of Lightning page in the App Builder.
        It provides 3 vertical zones in a 25%-50%-25% horizontal repartition, the lateral two
        zones being foldable.</p>
    <p>Leveraging the <code>&lt;c:PEG_Context_CMP&gt;</code> component, there is a possibility
        to manage default alues for the fold/unfold state of each foldable zone. The context
        should simply contain a <code>template</code> attribute set to a JSON object with two
        boolean state attributes.</p>
<pre>let context = { "template":{"isLeftOpen":true,"isRightOpen":false} };</pre>
