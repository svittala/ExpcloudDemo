    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_FieldSetDisplay_CMP&gt;</code> component enables to display
        a set of fields of the current record in various ways, i.e. horizontal list,
        vertical list or definition list (with or without labels depending on the case).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The set of fields may be defined by selecting one of the FieldSets defined
            on the current object from the App Builder.</li>
        <li>Beware that FLS are applied and that any unauthorized field
        is removed from the list.</li>
        <li>3 modes are available depending on the preferred layout.</li>
        <li>A title may be shown, presenting the label of the FieldSet.</li>
        <li>Additional CSS classes (selected from the SLDS) may be specified to
            adapt the containing div element (e.g. to play with margins, background...).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Warning: This component relies on the Lightning Data Service (LDS)
       and therefore only works with objects supported by the
       <a href="/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning:recordViewForm/documentation">
       <code>lightning:recordViewForm</code></a> standard component.</p>
