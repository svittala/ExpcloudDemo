    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_SoqlListMulti_CMP&gt;</code> component may be used in any type of
        Lightning page and is available directly in the App Builder (or Community Builder).
        It enables to display in a single component multiple sets of list views implemented via
        <code>&lt;c:PEG_SoqlList_CMP&gt;</code> sub-components.</p>
    <p>In the global component card header, a selection box enables to choose a category of
        list views displayed within sub-tabs, each one containing a data table corresponding
        to a specific SOQL query.</p>
    <p>Each level is configurable and may have its own set of actions, the main configuration
        attribute being <code>soqlListStr</code>, a stringified version of a JSON object
        describing the whole selector/sub-tab organisation of data-tables.</p>
