    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_Graphs_CMP&gt;</code> component may be used in any type of
        Lightning page and is available directly in the App Builder (or Community Builder).
        It enables to display a simple bar or doughnut/pie Graph based on in a custom
        SOQL query.</p>
    <p>It relies on the open-source <code>graph.js</code> library to display graphs
        as similar as possible as the ones found in the standard Lightning Reports
        and Dashboards.</p>
    <p>For doughnut/pie chart, only one aggregation dimension may be used (i.e. <code>XXX</code>
        in a <code>...GROUP BY XXX...</code> SOQL query), each measure (i.e. <code>Count()</code>,
        <code>Sum()</code>, <code>Max()</code>... statement in a SOQL query) being displayed in a
        separate chart.</p>
    <p>For (vertical or horizontal) bar chart, one or two dimensions may be used. When a
        main and a secondary dimensions are used (i.e. <code>XXX</code> and <code>YYY</code>
        in a <code>...GROUP BY XXX, YYY...</code> SOQL query), the main one is used for
        stacking measures in a bar chart split by the secondary one.</p>
    <p>Multiple configuration options are available as in the <code>&lt;c:PEG_SoqlList_CMP&gt;</code>
        component (global card display, header actions, SOQL execution tuning...).</p>
    <p>For the SOQL query, the context merging provided by the <code>&lt;c:PEG_Merge_CMP&gt;</code>
        component may be used to refine its <code>WHERE</code> filtering clause.</p>

    <h4>Pie/Doughnut Chart Usage</h4>
    <p>In the most simple use case, the <code>&lt;c:PEG_Graphs_CMP&gt;</code> may be used
        to display various measures split by a same dimension.</p>
<pre>&lt;c:PEG_Graphs_CMP
    query='select Status, COUNT(Id) Number, COUNT_DISTINCT(AccountId) Accounts from Case WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED Group by Status'
    graphType='pie'
    dimension='Status'
    dimensionLabel='Status'
    measureStr='["Number","Accounts"]'
    title='Case KPIs'
    icon='standard:case'
    /&gt;</pre>
        <b>Notes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>The secondary dimension (<code>subDimension</code>) fields should
                then be left blank.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, the <code>graphType</code> attribute may be set to
                <code>doughnut</code>.</li>
            <li>In the SOQL query, measures should be explicitely named (e.g. 
                <code>Accounts</code> in the <code>Count_Distinct(AccountId) Accounts</code>
                SOQL clause above) in order to be identified in the <code>measureStr</code>
                attribute.</li>
        </ul>
    <br/>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slds-m-top_large">
    <h4>Bar Chart Usage</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_Graphs_CMP&gt;</code> may also be used to display to
        display various measures split by up to two dimensions.</p>
<pre>&lt;c:PEG_Graphs_CMP
    query='select StageName, Type, count(Id) Number, sum(Amount) Amount from Opportunity WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED Group by StageName, Type'
    graphType='bar'
    dimension='Type'
    dimensionLabel='Type'
    subDimension='StageName'
    subDimensionLabel='StageName'
    measureStr='["Number","Amount"]'
    title='Opportunity KPIs'
    icon='standard:opportunity'
    /&gt;</pre>
        <b>Notes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>The secondary dimension (<code>subDimension</code>) fields are
                optional. It must only be used in case of a SOQL grouping by 2
                dimension fields. Bar charts display properly also with only
                one dimension (in which case, no stacking occurs).</li>
            <li>Alternatively, the <code>graphType</code> attribute may be set to
                <code>horizontalBar</code> or <code>line</code>.</li>
            <li>In the SOQL query, measures should be explicitely named (e.g. 
                <code>Accounts</code> in the <code>Count_Distinct(AccountId) Accounts</code>
                SOQL clause above) in order to be identified in the <code>measureStr</code>
                attribute.</li>
        </ul>
