    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_ActivityList_CMP&gt;</code> component may be used in any type of Lightning
        page and is available directly in the App Builder (or Community Builder).
        It enables to display a custom activity timeline, very similar to the standard lightning
        component, but providing ways to completely customise the selection condition of the 
        Tasks and/or Events to display (via custom SOQL <code>where</code> clauses).</p>
    <p>It relies on the same principles as the <code>&lt;c:PEG_SoqlList_CMP&gt;</code> component
        to offer custom actions at header or row levels.</p>
    <p>It relies on the <code>&lt;c:PEG_ActivityDisplay_CMP&gt;</code> component to properly
        display each individual task/event retrieved (icon, color, flags...), the actual set
        of fields displayed not being configurable as of now.</p>
    <p>The resulting activities are ordered by descending due date, tasks and events combined.</p>
