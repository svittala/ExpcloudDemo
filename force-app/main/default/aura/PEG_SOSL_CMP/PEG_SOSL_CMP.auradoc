    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_SOSL_CMP&gt;</code> component is a pure utility Lightning component.
        It provides one method to Lightning components to execute operations on the Salesforce
        database: <code>runQuery</code> for SOSL queries.</p>
    <p>In order to call these methods, the requesting Lightning component just has to instanciate
        the <code>&lt;c:PEG_SOSL_CMP&gt;</code> within its body and give it a unique
        <code>aura:id</code> to be able to find it easily to call its methods.</p>
<pre>&lt;c:PEG_SOSL_CMP  aura:id="soslUtil"/&gt;</pre>

    <h4>Executing SOSL queries</h4>
    <p>In order to trigger a SOSL query, just call the <code>runQuery</code> method on the 
        <code>&lt;c:PEG_SOSL_CMP&gt;</code> component, providing the SOSL query to execute,
        the two boolean flags (controlling respectively the caching use and the background mode),
        and a callback method to process the results (with two JSON object parameters containing
        respectively the result of the query or its error).</p>
<pre>component.find('soslUtil').runQuery(
     "FIND 'test' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account (Name)",
     false, false,
     function(queryResult,queryError) {
          if (queryResult) {
              // process OK (in queryResult object)
              ...
          } else {
              // process KO (in queryError object)
              ...
          }});</pre>
